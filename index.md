# LCS Companion FAQ

## There is a game live but the app says there are no live games
This likely means that Riot's data server is down.

## All I see is a loading circle
This means my backend is down for some reason. I will be notified and will address the issue promptly.

## Further Support
If you have an issue outside of that, I would like to know about it! Please go over to [my discord](https://discord.gg/zjcQhv8) to let me know.
